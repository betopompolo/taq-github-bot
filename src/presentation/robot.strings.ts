      Congratulations! You just finished the onboard! ðŸŽ‰

      Thank you for participating, we hope you could learn a lot. The main goal of this onboard is to make you ready to enter the project.

      As you advance on the project, we'd like to hear your feedback. Please, contact your tutors and let them know your thoughts:

      - What do you think was very useful on the onboard?
      - What do you think that could be better?
      - Did you work on something on your project that you think it should be here?
      - What do you think about the time we reserved for the onboard?
      - What do you think about the all process: the bot, the little project, the meetings and the support of the tutors?
