      Congratulations! You just finished the onboard! ðŸŽ‰

      Thank you for participating, we hope you've learned a lot. The main goal of this onboard is to make you ready to enter in any of our backend projects.

      - What do you think was very useful on the onboard?
      - What do you think that could be better?
      - Did you work on something on your project that you think it should be here?
      - What do you think about the time we reserved for each step of the onboard?
      - What do you think about the time we reserved for the all process of the onboard?
      - What do you think about the all process: the bot, the project you've developed, the meetings and the support of the tutors? Honesty, please ðŸ˜„
