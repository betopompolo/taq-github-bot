# Step 1 - Create a new Branch

To create a branch, go to Terminal in your Project's folder and type this command:

```batch
git checkout -b "name_of_your_branch"
```

With this, you'll create a new branch and change the current working branch to this new one. Your new branch should be named `develop`
