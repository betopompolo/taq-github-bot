# Step 2/3 - Create the 'develop' branch

To create a new branch, go to Terminal in your Project's folder and type this command:

```batch
git checkout -b name_of_your_branch
```

With this, you'll create a new branch and change the current working branch to this new one. Your new branch should be named `develop`

**Note**: after created, don't forget to push your new branch to remote repository (a.k.a `origin`). You can check all the branches of this remote repository on the network page: `github.com/your_github/your_repo/network`, or accessing `Insights` -> `Network`.
