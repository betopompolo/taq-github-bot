# Step 1/3 - Feature request!
#### Estimated time: 15 min

So, let's assume we received a feture request: now our users should be able to have one or more addresses registered on their accounts. The information needed for this new feature is:

- CEP (postal code)
- Street
- Street number
- Complement (optional)
- Neighborhood
- City
- State

One simple solution could be just add these columns on User database table, right? Well... it should be an ok solution **if** each user should have **only one** address associated. Since we have the possibility of more addresses, we couldn't know how many columns to add, and so we need to explore another solution for this.

Before continuing, try giving some toughts yourself about how to achieve this ðŸ¤”ðŸ¤”ðŸ¤”
If you reach a solution, do some research on the internet to compare or explore more possibilities. Then, go to next track.
