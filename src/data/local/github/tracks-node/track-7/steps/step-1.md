# Step 1/3 - The query
### Estimated time: 2 hours

This is the first query you're going to implement on the project. After logging in and creating user, now it's time to provide a query for fetching a user information. Some details:

1. **Query Name:** `user`
1. **Parameter:** a user id
1. It's authenticated
1. **Response:** a user type, that you already have by now.

Unlike the previous tracks, now you're going to write the query prototype and integrate with the database already.

**NOTE:** don't forget to predict error cases. In this query, the most obvious one is passing an id that is not found on database.
