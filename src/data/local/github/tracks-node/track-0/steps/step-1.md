# Taqtile - Onboard

Welcome to the Taqtile onboard. It will help you to get used to our technology stack, patterns and best practices.

Thoughout your onboard, you will develop a server able to:

1. Store some data in a database (db)
1. [CRUD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Create,_read,_update_and_delete) that data stored in db

# Step 1/3 - Warming up - Mastering the Basics

Ok! Your very first tasks are to **clone this repository** into your own account and **update the README.md** file.

But before moving on, let's be sure you know all the basics we use daily here.

We use [git](https://git-scm.com/)... a lot. If you don't feel confident in your skills using git, here are some recommendations:

- https://try.github.io/
- https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials
- https://learngitbranching.js.org/

BTW, we highly encourage training using the terminal.

On the end of every task of this onboard, comment the word `Finish` on the issue to receive your next task (you can try reloading the page if it's taking too long).
You can also comment the word `next`, in case you had to skip the current task.
Any problem with me, you can ask your tutor for help.
