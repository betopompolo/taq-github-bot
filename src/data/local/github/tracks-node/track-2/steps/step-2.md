# Step 2 - GraphQL setup
#### Estimated time: 4 hours

In this step you'll have two main tasks: **create a typescript project** and **setup a graphql server**. You can both setup these by yourself as showed in [this tutorial](https://www.howtographql.com/graphql-js/1-getting-started/) or use a cli to make this whole setup for you as [shown here](https://github.com/graphql-boilerplates/typescript-graphql-server/tree/master/basic) (we won't tell anyone ðŸ¤«).

After the setup, you should be able to access the Graphql docs (on browser, [Graphiql](https://github.com/graphql/graphiql) or [Graphql Playground](https://github.com/prisma/graphql-playground)) and successfully write some GraphQL query.

**Note:** For now on, some steps will have an **estimated time** to help you organizing your time better. 
If you do not finish the step in the estimated time **don't worry**! It's just an average time based on previous onboards. The main purpose of it is to indicate when you should ask for help in case you're stuck.

By the way, remember that if you're struggling with any topic, feel free asking any Taqtiler ;)
