# Step 2 - The concepts

Let's present all the concepts and tools we're going to use on your server. There are a lot of them, but don't be frightened, this is why this onboard exists. Some of them may be familiar to you depending on your background.

Each person has its unique method of learning things, so use your best method based on the suggested links and/or the internet. 

1. **Typescript:** this is what we call a **superset** of the javascript language. It helps us a lot developing, with the types and other features. You can check [their website](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) for more info.
1. **Node:** our core [environment](https://nodejs.org/)
1. **Express:** [framework](https://expressjs.com/) for building node applications.
1. **HTTP communication and REST:** this is pre-requisite for the next one.
1. **GraphQL**: it's a query-language that follows REST model. Facebook created it for the community to use. Check [their docs](https://graphql.org/) and/or this [tutorial](https://www.howtographql.com/)
1. **GraphQL Yoga**: a [tool](https://github.com/prisma/graphql-yoga) to make it easier to setup a GraphQL server.
1. **Postgres**: the [relational database](https://www.postgresql.org/about/) (SQL) we use.
1. **Docker**: we use [docker](https://www.docker.com/) mainly to make it easier for us to create containers for the database on our machines.

There are also some core libraries we use here. They will be presented as the onboard progresses.

Go to the next step after taking a look on each of these items, and remember you can ask us anything that was not clear after your reseacrh ;)
