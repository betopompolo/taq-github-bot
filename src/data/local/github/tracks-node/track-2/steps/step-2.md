# Step 2/4 - GraphQL setup
#### Estimated time: 3 hours

In this step you'll have two main tasks: **create a node project with typescript** and **setup a graphql server**. But before you start, there are some core concepts you need to know in order to understand what's going on on your code. Try to do some research on your own about these topics, but feel free to ask your tutor, or even another Taqtiler, for references, tips and/or clarifications:

1. Client-server architecture
1. HTTP communication
1. REST
1. GraphQL

You can find any GraphQL server setup on internet to get this done. But to finish this task, make sure you have, in the end:

1. A proper GraphQL server set up
1. Typescript installed and being used
1. One query called `Hello` that correctly returns a string: "Hello, World!"

If you want some suggestions, you can begin with:

- GraphQL [Getting Started](https://graphql.org/graphql-js/) guide
- GraphQL [Running Express + GraphQL](https://graphql.org/graphql-js/running-an-express-graphql-server/) guide

To get you more familiar with our projects, we recommend you follow the above guides, and then use [Apollo Server](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/apollo-server/getting-started/) to setup your GraphQL Server. It's a library that makes GraphQL setup easier and has some nice features encapsulated. For example, the express itself.

Don't forget that you should add **[Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)** to your project! We will talk about why we use it on a meeting.

After the setup, you should be able to access the Graphql docs, either on browser, [Graphiql](https://github.com/graphql/graphiql) or [Graphql Playground](https://github.com/prisma/graphql-playground) (you can choose the one you like) and successfully write some GraphQL queries/mutations. You can use the `Hello` query to verify your server is working. Keep this query for future testing!

**Note:** For now on, some steps will have an **estimated time** to help you organizing your time better.
If you do not finish the step in the estimated time **don't worry**! It's just an average time based on previous onboards. The main purpose of it is to indicate when you should ask for help in case you're stuck.

By the way, remember that if you're struggling with any topic, feel free to ask any Taqtiler ;)
