# Step 3 - A simple Hello World
#### Estimated time: 2 hours

**NOTE:** Please make sure you understood at least the basics of **GraphQL** before beginning this step.

Your task now is to create very simple node server using the concepts from previous step. You can follow some tutorials of your choice for this setup, but please consider some recommendations we have below, so you can become to get used to the stack and tools we use here. You can change the order if you want, too.

1. Setup [graphql-yoga](https://github.com/prisma/graphql-yoga): this makes very easy to create a GraphQL server.
1. Add typescript to your project

After the setup, you should be able to access the graphl docs (on browser, [Graphiql](https://github.com/graphql/graphiql) or [Graphql Playground](https://github.com/prisma/graphql-playground)) and successfully write the GraphQL `Hello` query.

**NOTE 2:** it's very important for you to not be satisfied with the successfull setup only. Knowing, at least at a top-level, what's going on with that code and what are the files/variables responsible for is essential. Take a moment look at your code and check if you would be capable of explaining briefly what are the functions of the files below:

+ package.json (and its fields)
+ tsconfig.json
+ node_modules
+ The variables `typeDefs` and `resolvers` on the yoga setup above

If after your study you still don't know what any of the above does, go ask for help ;)

**Note 3:** For now on, some steps will have an **estimated time** to help you organizing your time better. 
If you do not finish the step in the estimated time **don't worry**! It's just an average time based on previous onboards. The main purpose of it is to indicate when you should ask for help in case you're stuck.

By the way, remember that if you're struggling with any topic, feel free asking any Taqtiler ;)
