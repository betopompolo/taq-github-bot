# Step 3/6 - Create a Pull Request

- Open a Pull Request of your `feature/setup-graphql` branch

If you don't remember how to open a Pull Request, check out the references in the previous issues. Your PR should have `develop` branch as base, to be merged into later.

This pull request will be reviewed by your Taqtile tutor and possibly by some other people. This process is called **Code Review (CR)**. You can ask your tutor who will be revising your code and add them as collaborators to this github repository of yours.

Make sure you're marking them on every Pull Request as reviewers. Check [here](https://github.com/indigotech/br-qsaude-ecommerce-api/pull/119) for an example of Code Review. You'll possibly have some changes requested/suggested in order to merge this new branch on `develop`.

After opening the pull request, you can continue your work on a new branch.
