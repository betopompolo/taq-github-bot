# Step 4/5 - Typescript and Apollo Server
#### Estimated time: 3 hours

In this step you'll have two main tasks: **add Typescript to your project** and use **Apollo Server** to setup GraphQL. 

But first, lets create a new branch. You can call it `feature/apollo-typescript-setup` (but for now on, you're going to choose the branches names üòº).

[Apollo Server](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/apollo-server/) is a nice library that we use to make GraphQL setup much easier. You can follow a tutorial of your choice on the internet to get this step done. There are a bunch of posts like "create a Node GraphQL Server with Apollo Server and Typescript" or something like that üìù.

To make sure your done, you should test your server the same way you did on previous step: start the server and check if the `hello` query is returning accordingly. After you finish, open a new branch (following our name conventions) and a new Pull Request.

**NOTE:** when you open a PR, you have to select two branches: the "compare", the branch you're working, and the "base", which is the branch you desire to merge yours. Try to choose the "base" branch that allows reviewers to see only the changed code, without showing previous PR changes. Look on the internet for ways to see your branches sketched to help you do this. If you have any difficulties, feel free to ask your tutors, or any Taqtiler üòâ.
