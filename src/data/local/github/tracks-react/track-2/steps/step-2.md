# Step 2/5 - Create a simple Hello World
#### Estimated time: 3 hours

Follow a tutorial project to create a minimal "Hello World" application using the technology stack you were assigned. If you don't know on which stack you are, please ask your tutor before continuing. We use **react** for web projects and **react-native** for apps, both using **Typescript**. Read them carefully:

## React

+ They have a [this awesome](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/adding-typescript) tutorial to begin developing
+ You only have to run `npx create-react-app your-project-name --template typescript` on terminal
+ Clean up some code to show only a simple "Hello World"

## React-native

+ Start with [their tutorial](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup) to make sure you have everything you need. Use the `React Native CLI Quickstart`, so you can be closer to how a Taqtile project works.
+ When you reach the code setup, use the command with Typescript template: `npx react-native init YourProjectName --template react-native-template-typescript`
+ Clean up some code to show only a simple "Hello World"
+ You can call it "done" after you're running it successfully on Android and iOS emulator (or device, if you prefer ðŸ¤“)

**Note:** For now on, some steps will have an **estimated time** to help you organizing your time better. 
If you do not finish the step in the estimated time **don't worry**! It's just an average time based on previous onboards. The main purpose of this estimated time is to indicate when you should ask for help in case you're stuck.

By the way, remember that if you're struggling with any topic, feel free asking any Taqtiler ;)
