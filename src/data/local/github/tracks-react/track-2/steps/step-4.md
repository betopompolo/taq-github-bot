# Step 4/5 - Update README.md

### Estimated time: 20 minutes

Do you remember we created the `README.md` of this project before? Now that you have a project created on your technology stack, it's time to update it with some piece of information.

Since the `feature/setup` is (probably) still being reviewed, we need to create a new branch for this current step's task. Let's call this new branch `docs/update-readme`. Here's what you'll need to do:

- Go to develop branch: `git checkout develop`
- Open a new branch called `docs/update-readme`
- Update the `Environment and tools` section with some data about... well... your machine environment and the tools you're using. Things like the Node version, the Android Studio version, the programming language any other relevant data for a developer to getting started in your project.
- The `Steps to run and debug` section is usually filled with information about how to run your project, such as what commands should the developer use or which configurations should he/she turn on/off before executing your project.

After that, open a pull request with these `README.md` changes.

**TIP:** an excellent README is that one document that is sufficient for any developer to be able run and contribute to your project.
