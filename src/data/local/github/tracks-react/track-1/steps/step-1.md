# Step 1/3 - Update README.md

This one is easy. All you have to do is add the following topics to `README.md` file. Just remember that these modifications must be done in your **local README** file. With that in mind, add these topics:

  - Project's Name (pick one 😎)
  - Project's Description
  - Environment and tools *
  - Steps to run and debug *

The section with * you'll fill in later steps 👍.

After you fill `README.md`, commit the changes and push to `master` branch.
