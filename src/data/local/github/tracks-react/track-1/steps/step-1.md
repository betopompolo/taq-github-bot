# Step 1 - Update README.md

This one is easy. All you have to do is add the following topics to `README.md` file. Just remember that these modifications must be done in **local README** file you just cloned. With that in mind, add these topics:

  - Project's Name (pick one ðŸ˜Ž)
  - Project's Description
  - Environment and tools *
  - Steps to run and debug *

Note that you will be asked to fill the section with * later.

After you fill `README.md`, commit these changes and push to `master` branch.
