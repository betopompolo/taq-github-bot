# Step 5/5: Challenge: Loading indicator
#### Estimated time: 2 hours

In order to give some feedback of what's going on inside your app, the challenge is to show a **loading indicator**, inside the login page, while the GraphQL request is being made.

Here are some SUGGESTIONS (don't mind about styling for now) of loading indicator:

### Button Load (with change of text)

### Page loading

![Page Loading](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/indigotech/taq-github-bot/master/images/load-screen.jpg)

**NOTE:** while on load, the user should not be able to click on the button again. This way we avoid performing the login request more times unecessarily.
