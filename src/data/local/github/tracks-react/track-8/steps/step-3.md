# Step 3/4 - Styled components library
#### Estimated time: 1 hour

After some minutes of theory, it's finally time to put all the previous thoughts on code.

We'll start with a setup of some tools for our UX development. Here at Taqtile we use the [Styled Components](https://www.styled-components.com/docs/basics) library, which helps us to styling our components in a very convenient way.

For now, your job is to install the library and understand at least the basic concepts. Try to use it creating a very simple component to check if it's working, and then go to next step.
