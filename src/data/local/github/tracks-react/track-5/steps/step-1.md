Login is done. Now, let's make the user list UI.

# Step 1/3 - Users List Frontend (FE)
#### Estimated time: 3 hours

This screen will list all registered users. Each list cell (or list row) should contain:
  - user name
  - user email

Like the login page, you can layout your users list page the way you want. Just remember to [keep things simple](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle).

**Note:** In order to test the frontend, is a common practice to fill your view components with some fake data. Since you don't have the real data yet, you can create a fake, static user list to test your screen.
