# Step 2/2 - Login validations
#### Estimated time: 2 hours

**(Re-Re-)Note:** Don't forget to open a new branch!

When filling up a form, users (us) can mispell something or forget to fill all the inputs in a form. So in this step you'll create some form validations.

Your login screen should have the following validations:

- **Email input**:
  - Should have a valid email format: ###@###.com
  - Should not be empty (required field)

- **Password input**:
  - Should not be empty (required field)
  - Minimum of 7 characters
  - Should have at least one digit and one letter

All these validations should be triggered when the user taps the submit button, showing error messages accordingly.

**NOTE:** as usual, create a new branch and open a Pull Request after you've done it.
By the way, every task from now on should be made on a new branch. This has several benefits, such as:
+ CR process becomes easier and more effective with less code
+ Allows possible version rollbacks without having to worry with the feature branches commits.
