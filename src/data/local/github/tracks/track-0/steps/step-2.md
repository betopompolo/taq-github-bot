# Step 3 - Update README.md

This one is easy. All you have to do is add the following topics to README.md file. Just remember that these modifications must be done in **local README** file you just cloned. With that in mind, add these topics in README.md:

  - Change project's name (pick one kk)
  - Environment and tools need to develop
  - Configurations
  - Steps to run and debug
  - Build process
  - Gotcha's

Since you don't know what are the specifications of your project, you won't be able to fill in all data, but you will have a basic structure to fill in later.
