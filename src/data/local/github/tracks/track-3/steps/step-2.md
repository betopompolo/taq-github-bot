When filling up a form, users (us) can mispell something or forget to fill all the inputs in a form. So in this step you'll create some form validations.

Your login screen should have the following validations:

- **Email input**:
  - Should have a valid email format: ###@###.com
  - Should not be empty (required field)

- **Password input**:
  - Minimum of 7 characters, with at least one digit and one alphanumeric
  - Should not be empty (required field)

All these validations should be triggered when the user taps the submit button, showing message errors accordingly. Here are some examples of form validation:
