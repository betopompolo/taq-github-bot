With everything set up, it's coding time! (finally)

**(Re-)Note:** because this is a new step, don't forget to open a new branch!

# Step 1 - Login screen Frontend
#### Estimated time: 2 hours

Your task now is to create the Login Screen frontend. That means laying out the view components (inputs, buttons, images...) in the screen. In the frontend steps, you **don't need to** make web requests, save data locally and etc. Your job here is **only** layout properly all the view components you'll need in your screen.

Talking about view components, your screen should have a form containing:

- **an email input**
- **a password input**
- **a submit button**

You can use the following image as an inspiration:

![login](../images/login.jpg)

Don't mind the styles, borders and colors, you can choose your own, if you want to.

Once you've done, open a PR.

**Note**: Bear in mind that this task is only the login screen **frontend**, which means that, for now, you don't have to communicate with server to check the user credentials for example. All you have to do here is to layout properly all the view components you'll need in your screen.
