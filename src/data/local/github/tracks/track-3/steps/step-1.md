With everything set up, it's coding time! (finally)

**(Re-)Note:** because this is a new step, don't forget to open a new branch!

# Step 1 - Login screen Frontend
#### Estimated time: 2 hours

Your task now is to create the Login Screen frontend. That means laying out the view components (inputs, buttons, images...) in the screen. In the frontend steps, you **don't need to** make web requests, save data locally and etc. Your job here is **only** layout properly all the view components you'll need in your screen.

Talking about view components, your screen should have a form containing:

- **an email input**
- **a password input**
- **a submit button**

You can use the following images as inspiration:
> TODO: Trocar as imagens

Once you've done, open a PR.
