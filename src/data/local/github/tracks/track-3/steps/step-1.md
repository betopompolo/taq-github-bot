With everything set up, it's coding time! (finally)

Your task now is to create a **Login Screen**.

**(Re-)Note:** because this is a new task, don't forget to open a new branch to do it.

# Step 1 - Login screen

Your screen should have a form containing:

- [ ] **an email input** that:
  - [ ] must match email format 
  - [ ] is required

- [ ] **a password input** that:
  - [ ] password - minimum of 7 characters, with at least one digit and one alphanumeric
  - [ ] is required

- [ ] **a submit button**

**Note**: The validations should be triggered when the user taps the submit button, showing message errors accordingly.
