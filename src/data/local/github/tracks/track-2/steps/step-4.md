# Step 4 - Update README.md

Do you remember we created the README.md of this project before? Now that you have a project created on your technology stack, you can update it with some information.

We are considering this is a new task, so it's better not to do it on the same branch of the previous one (`feature/setup`), because that branch has a pull request being reviewed.

- Go to develop branch: `git checkout develop`
- Open a new branch called `docs/update-readme`
- Update the `Environment and tools` section with some info about the developer machine environment, like node version for React, android studio version for Android, xcode version for iOS, and other relevant info for a developer to be able to run your project
- Update the `Steps to run and debug` section with information on how to run your project (what commands should the developer use?)
- Open other pull request with these changes on README.md

This is good practice on projects to help other developers contribute with it.
