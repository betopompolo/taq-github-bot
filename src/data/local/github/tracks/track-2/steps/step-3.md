# Step 3 - Create a Pull Request

- Open a Pull Request of your `feature/setup` branch

If you don't remember how to open a Pull Request, check out the references in the previous issues.

**Note:** this pull request will be revised by your Taqtile tutor. This process is called **Code Review (CR)**. You'll possibly have some changes requested/suggested, but after that you will be able to merge this new branch on `develop`.
