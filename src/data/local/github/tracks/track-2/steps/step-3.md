# Step 3 - Create a Pull Request

- Open a Pull Request of your `feature/setup` branch

If you don't remember how to open a Pull Request, check out the references in the previous issues. Your PR should point to `develop` branch, to be merged later.

**Note:** This pull request will be revised by your Taqtile tutor. This process is called **Code Review (CR)**. You'll possibly have some changes requested/suggested in order to merge this new branch on `develop`.

**Note 2:** You want your pull request to be reviewed right? So please remember to assign your Taqtile mentor as the PR reviewer! If you're having problems, feel free to ask.
