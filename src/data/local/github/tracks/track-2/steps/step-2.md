# Step 2 - Create a simple Hello World
#### Estimated time: 3 hours

Follow a tutorial project to create a minimal "Hello World" application using the technology stack you were assigned. If you don't know on which stack you are, please ask your tutor before continuing.

- [React](https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript-React-Starter)
- [React Native](https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript-React-Native-Starter): on the beggining, follow the `React Native CLI Quickstart` instead of `Expo CLI Quickstart`.

**Note:** For now on, some steps will have an **estimated time** to help you organizing your time better. 
If you do not finish the step in the estimated time **don't worry**! It's just an average time based on previous onboards. The main purpose of this estimated time is to indicate when you should ask for help in case you're stuck.

By the way, remember that if you're struggling with any topic, feel free asking any Taqtiler ;)
