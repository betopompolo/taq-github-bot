- Create a branch called `feature/setup`

If you don't remember how to create a branch, check the references in the previous steps.

**Note**: From here, the issues will contain fewer tutorials and step-by-step guides. However, it doesn't mean you won't be able to ask. You can always ask **anything** to **any** Taqtiler. We are here to help 😉

**Note 2:** Be patient, this is the last setup before coding. 👍
