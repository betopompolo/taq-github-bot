#### Estimated time: 8 hours

With all setted up, your task is to apply the UX concepts you've learn and **componentize** your UI elements of **Add User** and **Login** screen.

Here's how we'll do this: In the **Add User** page, your task is to implement the components as follows:
// TODO add image

When you're done, try to reuse the **Login** page UI elements with those you've created in the Add User page.

**Note:** For the following tracks we will focus only in the **Login** and **Add User** screens. Of course that when you're done the onboard, you can refactor the other parts of your app, but let's 'fix' these two screens first ðŸ˜‰.
