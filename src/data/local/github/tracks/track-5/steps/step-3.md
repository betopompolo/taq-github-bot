# Challenge: Add pagination to the list
#### Estimated time: 4 hours

Generally, lists with a minimum amount items are paginated. We currently use 3 types of pagination:

- [Classical](https://dribbble.com/shots/4144198-Daily-UI-085-Pagination) - displaying page numbers, eventually a next and previous button
- [Infinite list with next button](https://dribbble.com/shots/9331-Load-More-Channels) - at the end of the list, a button with "load more"
- [Infinite scroll](https://dribbble.com/shots/3567980-Infinite-Feed) - the app automatically loads the next page of the user is near the end of the list

That said, your challenge is to add the pagination into the list you've just implement: the users list.
