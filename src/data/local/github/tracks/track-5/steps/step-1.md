Login is done. Now, let's make the user list UI.

# Step 1 - Users List Frontend

#### Estimated time: TODO: add estimated time

This screen will list all registered users. Each cell should contain:
  - user name
  - user role

Like the login page, you can layout your users list page the way you want. Just remember to [keep things simple](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle).


**Note**: Bear in mind that this task is only the users list **frontend**, which means you don't have to get the real users list data, for example. All you have to do here is to layout properly all the view components you'll need in your screen.

**Note2**: In order to test the frontend, is a common practice to fill your view components with some fake data. Since you don't have the real data yet, you can create a fake, static user data list to test your screen.
