# Step 2 - Challenge: Add pagination to the list

Generally, lists with a minimum amount items are paginated. We currently use 3 types of pagination:

- classical - displaying page numbers, eventually a next and previous button ([reference](https://dribbble.com/shots/4144198-Daily-UI-085-Pagination))
- infinite list with next button - at the end of the list, a button with "load more" ([reference](https://dribbble.com/shots/9331-Load-More-Channels))
- infinite scroll - the app automatically loads the next page of the user is near the end of the list ([reference](https://dribbble.com/shots/3567980-Infinite-Feed))
