# Step 2 - Create the 'develop' Branch

To create a new branch, go to Terminal in your Project's folder and type this command:

```batch
git checkout -b "name_of_your_branch"
```

With this, you'll create a new branch and change the current working branch to this new one. Your new branch should be named `develop`

Note: after created, don't forget to push your new branch to remote repository (a.k.a `origin`).
